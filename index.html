    <h1>Hi! I'm Drew Stock.</h1>
    <h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
    <p>In 2013, my wife, April &amp; I moved to Portland from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I'm still a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers &amp; Penguins (2016 Stanley Cup champions! Woo hoo!) and now I'm also a fan of the Portland Timbers! I've grown to love the culture, food and craft beers of Portland and the Pacific NW in general. I also love to explore our beautiful natural surroundings, and go hiking in the Columbia River Gorge and biking on all our local bike trails.</p>
